# ***Open Source Thermal Microscopy***

**Welcome to the Open Source Thermal Microscopy repository! This resource provides detailed
guidance for constructing custom-built luminescence microscopes and is developed and
maintained by the group of Prof. Andrea Pickel. These microscope designs are targeted
particularly at nanoscale thermometry applications but may be broadly relevant to non-
biological microscopy applications across engineering and the physical sciences. The repository
is divided into the following major sections:**

### * *Building Blocks*

### * *Microscopes*
This section provides detailed guidance for constructing, optimizing, and
operating different types of microscopes using parts from the Building Blocks section.
The most basic model is the “Single-Nanoparticle Thermometry” microscope. All other
microscopes can be constructed by modifying or adding on to this basic model.
### * *Software*
While the major focus of this repository is hardware, software is nonetheless
an integral component of any microscopy system. This section both describes the
software we use to control our microscopes and provides open source code for custom
data analysis GUIs.

 *We are grateful to the many University of Rochester undergraduate and graduate students,
faculty, and staff who have contributed to the contents of this repository, including Melanie
Earle, Nathan Nickerson, Ziyang Ye, and Dinesh Bommidi. We are also greatly indebted to Prof.
Nick Borys (now at Montana State), Prof. P. James Schuck (now at Columbia), Dr. Ed Barnard,
and many others at the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, whose extensive
expertise, guidance, and hardware and software development efforts are foundational to much
of the knowledge contained in this repository.*
