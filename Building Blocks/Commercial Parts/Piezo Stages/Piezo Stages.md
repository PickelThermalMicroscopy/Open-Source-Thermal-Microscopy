We use a three-axis Nano-T115 piezo nanopositioning stage from Mad City Labs, which has a 100 μm scan range in the x and y directions and a 50 μm scan range in the z direction. Other related options are available from Mad City Labs’ [Nano-T series of stages](http://www.madcitylabs.com/nanotseries.html). We find that the Nano-T115 is able to carry our thermal stage without any problems in terms of x and y motion; we have not tested the impact of this mass load on the z axis motion, which is most likely to be affected. Our Nano-T115 stage is mounted on top of a custom manual micropositioning stage (also from Mad City Labs) that is designed to fit on our Nikon Ti2-U microscope chassis.

Physik Instrumente (PI) offers [similar products](https://www.physikinstrumente.com/en/products/nanopositioning-piezo-flexure-stages/piezo-flexure-scanners), and we are aware of other research groups who are happy with their PI stages, although we have not used their products ourselves.
