We currently use a [ST-UT2 Tuned-Damped Upgradable Optical Table](https://www.newport.com/p/ST-UT2-510-12) with automatic re-leveling [pneumatic vibration isolators](https://www.newport.com/f/pneumatic-vibration-isolators-with-automatic-re-leveling) from Newport. This line of optical tables can be upgraded to include active damping if needed, although we have not found that to be necessary for our experiments to date. We float the optical table using a house compressed air line.
